# LLMSoundWare

## Overview

LLMSoundWare is a LLMWare + Streamlit web application that takes an audio file as input, transcribes it using LLMware models, and performs various analyses on the transcription. The app provides insights into sentiment, named entities, topics, categories, intents, emotions, and summaries extracted from the audio content. Additionally, it features an interactive chatbot powered by the Dragon model from LLMware, allowing users to ask questions about the audio and its analysis.

## Features

- **Audio Input:** Upload an audio file or record audio directly within the app.
- **Transcription:** Convert speech to text using LLMWare's WhisperCPP model.
- **Analysis:** Clean the transcription and analyze it for:
  - Sentiment 
  - Named Entities Recognition (NER)
  - Topics 
  - Categories 
  - Intent
  - Emotions 
  - Summary
- **Interactive Chatbot:** Chat with a Dragon model-powered assistant to inquire about the audio content and analysis results.
- Everything running locally (using Mac M1).
